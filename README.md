retain-recall
=============

Moved from googlecode svn project retain-recall-semantics

This is a reference implementation of retain/recall semantics.  To use
retain/recall, you only need the include/retain.hpp template header file.

A paper introducing the idea is at

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1st0uPvzHE5Ea9BthfJ7z8Rr2g-hUwPzDFRoYPfRokZU/edit?hl=en_US&authkey=CIaB7b0M

And published at

http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/access-data-items-in-ancestor-stack-fram/240155450

The make file should build the example applications with

 make all

And run them with

 make run
